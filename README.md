## Introduction

This repository serves as a hands-on guide to understanding Python through calculator implementations. Each implementation demonstrates a different programming paradigm, allowing you to see how the same problem can be solved in various ways. This approach deepens your understanding of Python and enhances your coding skills.

## Features

- Implementations of calculators using:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Functional Programming
  - Decorators
  - Match-case
  - Recursion
- Educational examples that illustrate core Python concepts
- Exception handling to manage errors effectively
- Getter and setter methods for encapsulation
- CLI tools for easy interaction

## Programming Paradigms

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In OOP, we encapsulate data and behavior within classes. This paradigm helps in organizing code and making it reusable. You will find examples of calculators that leverage classes and objects to manage state and behavior.

### Functional Programming

Functional programming emphasizes functions as first-class citizens. This approach avoids changing state and mutable data. The calculator implementations in this section showcase how to create calculators using pure functions and higher-order functions.

### Decorators

Decorators provide a way to modify the behavior of functions or methods. You will see how to use decorators to enhance calculator functionalities, such as logging operations or validating inputs.

### Match-case

Introduced in Python 3.10, the match-case statement offers a clean way to handle complex conditional logic. The examples in this repository demonstrate how to use match-case to create more readable and maintainable code.

### Recursion

Recursion involves a function calling itself to solve a problem. You will find examples of calculators that utilize recursion for tasks like evaluating expressions or calculating factorials.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Python Calculator Paradigms**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Farel17-Nuzhan/python-calculator-paradigms.git
   cd python-calculator-paradigms
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed. You can use pip to install any necessary packages.

3. **Run the calculator:**
   Navigate to the desired implementation and run the corresponding Python file.

## Usage

Each calculator implementation is located in its respective folder. You can explore the code and run the calculators directly. The README files within each folder provide specific instructions on how to use that implementation.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can run a simple OOP calculator:

```bash
python oop_calculator.py
```

Follow the prompts to perform calculations.
